# End-to-end-Netflix-data-analysis
What I Learned from the Project (Overall Summary)

Learned how to take a raw dataset and transform it into a fully structured, clean, and analysis-ready format.

Gained practical experience in end-to-end data handling — from cleaning in Excel, normalizing in SQL, to visualizing in Power BI.

Understood how to apply database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to eliminate redundancy and design efficient relational schemas.

Improved ability to break down multi-valued, inconsistent, and messy real-world data into organized tables.

Developed skills in connecting databases to BI tools and building interactive dashboards that provide meaningful insights.

Strengthened understanding of the full analytics workflow: data cleaning → modeling → analysis → visualization.

Gained confidence in working independently across multiple tools to deliver a complete data analytics project.
